Project Year 4 – Lifebuoy​ ​trackers

13th - 20th October 2017

1.Looked up sigfox compatible development boards.
2.Potentially settled on Arduino MKR FOX 1200 (https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkrfox1200).
 
20th - 27th October 2017

1.Had to look up the power efficiency of differnt boards and ways of decreasing power consumption.
2.Investigated long lasting and the self-discharge rate of different batteries.

30th - 3th November 2017

1.Done the research document.
2.Priced the needed components.

6th - 10th November 2017

1.Stared the Functional Spec
2.Ordered Sigfox Arduino

13th - 17th November 2017

1.Completed the Functional Spec
2.Started correcting the Research Doc

20th - 25th November 2017

1.Started writing basic programs for the mkrfox1200

27th - 1st November/December 2017

1.Ordered 3 sensors(accelerometer,altimeter and gps)

4th - 8th December 2017

1.Connected to the sigfox network and sent a test message to a email address

11th - 15th December 2017

1.Recieved sensors.
2.Got the altimeter connected and reading values

8th - 12th January 2017

1.Started using the gps module and the accelerometer sensor.
2.Decided to concentrate on using the above sensors as they seemed most suited to my project

15th - 19th January 2017

1.Ran into trouble with the gps module not working the majority of the time, also found that the mkrfox1200 could not connect to the sigfox network from my house.


22th - 26th January 2017

1.Got a messsage sending, on sensing of movement to the database(dynamodb)through the sigfox network.
2.Created a login/register and a page to show the locations of the lifebuoys, hardcoded for now.

29th - 2nd January/February 2017

1.Started refining the movement sensing code
2.Started trying to retrieve from the dynamodb.

5th - 9th January 2017

1.Completed the Functional Spec
2.Started correcting the Research Doc
